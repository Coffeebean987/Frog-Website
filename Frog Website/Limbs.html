        <h3>The growth and development of the frog</h3>

        <p>The frog, like humans, go through many body changes, such as an extra set of front legs, and the loss
            of their tail. Above is an example of these very changes. The picture above shows the complete changes 
            a frog goes through, from egg to adult. There are many books about frogs out there 
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/National-Geographic-Readers-Elizabeth-Carney-ebook/dp/B008OI5AZ0">for kids!</a>
            There are also books for adults, such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Frogs-Life-Size-Hundred-Species/dp/022618465X">
            this one here.</a>

        <p>Down below is a table, showing a few various types of frogs and whether they are dangerous or not.
            Remember, not all frogs are cute and friendly, some may pack a bite, or toxins/poisons that may kill you!
